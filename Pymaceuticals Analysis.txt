Conclusions from pymaceuticals data

	1. Infubinol, and Ceftamin are the two most successful drugs in reducing tumor size of the four selected. Ramicane and Capomulin are the worst.

	2. The researchers seemed to do a good job collecting the data. There is a good split between male and female,
 only two drugs are one mouse short, there was only one dublicate, and there was only one outlier.

	3. Ramicane and Capomulin were used on smaller overall tumor sizes, and may have been more relevant in a study specific to smaller tumors.
